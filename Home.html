    </h1>
    <p> <font color= #ffffff size="30" At a younger age I've misunderstood music, at the age of about 14 my love for rapp music started.<br/>
    My understanding of music specifically rapp is a way of expressing yourself or your feelings.
    <br/> Rapp music has evolved drastically over the last couple of years becoming more and more popular with new artists coming up overnight.
